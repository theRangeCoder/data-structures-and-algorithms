# Data Structures and Algorithms!
This repository contains my solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems, spread across varying levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard), to prepare myself thoroughly for cracking the coding interviews!<br/>

## Difficulty level: Easy
| Sl. No. | Problem description | Topic | My code (solution) | Remarks |
| :-----: | :-----------------: | :---: | :----------------: | :-----: |
| 1 | You are given a String str. Return the String by Concatenating it with String "Hello, " and an exclamation mark at the end “!” | Strings | [My code](https://github.com/theRangeCoder/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Easy/Hello%20User.py) |
| 2 | You are given two integers, a and b. Compute the Sum and Difference of a and b. Return the Product of Sum and Difference | Math | [My code](https://github.com/theRangeCoder/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Easy/Product%20Of%20Sum%20And%20Difference.py) |
